// The input limits the capability schema advertises. Kept in one place so a schema that accepts
// an input and an engine that rejects it cannot drift apart: every CEILING here must be matched in
// capabilities/chemistry/capability.json, and a step with ~40 reactants needs all of them.
//
// WHY THESE ARE DERIVED AND NOT WRITTEN DOWN. Every number below was once a constant, chosen when
// a large context window was 32,000 tokens. The models in use hold 1,000,000. The old constants do
// not fail loudly on a big model — they truncate the exact thing the big model was bought for:
//
//   - MAX_LABELS_TOTAL of 48 stopped RESOLVING NAMES past the 48th distinct one, and the code
//     treats an unresolved name as "unchecked, never a disagreement". So a long route silently
//     stopped being name-checked. One measured chain had 50 distinct species.
//   - the 8,000-character ceiling on the chat question refused the WHOLE compile call once a
//     correction prompt grew past it: 58 refusals across 26 of 30 targets on one sweep (B45).
//
// HOW A CAP IS DERIVED. Not an arbitrary fraction each: a cap is what the thing it bounds may
// cost inside the window. A text cap is a share of the window measured in characters. A count cap
// is that same share divided by what one item costs. The shares are small on purpose — these are
// the parts of one request, not the request.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* DERIVED, so nobody "finishes the job" later. A context window says
// nothing about chemistry or about RDKit's cost. These stay fixed:
//   MAX_COEFFICIENT (what a balanced equation looks like), MAX_CUT (a chemical claim about bond
//   edits), MAX_EMBEDDINGS / MAX_DEPARTURE_CHOICES / TARGET_MATCH_LIMIT (search and match cost),
//   MAX_CACHE_ENTRIES (memory), MAX_SMILES_SOURCE and MAX_SPECIES_CHARS / MAX_LABEL_NAME_CHARS
//   (no systematic name or SMILES gets longer because the model got roomier — 4,000 characters is
//   already far past the longest real one).

 *  These were raised together on 2026-10-08 for a 1,000,000-token window. Two of them were smaller
 *  than the engine behind them, which is the same drift in the other direction:
 *    - `names.items.maxLength` was 200 while the engine slices names at 4,000, and the engine's own
 *      comment says an assembled chain's systematic name "runs to several hundred characters" and
 *      that a cut one resolves to nothing. A long chain was refused before it was looked up.
 *    - `steps.maxItems` was 96 and `labels.items.maxItems` 24, against long linear routes written
 *      one transformation per unit, which is the shape the project is aiming at. */
